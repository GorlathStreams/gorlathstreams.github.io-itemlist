        <h3>Outline of each race:</h3>
        
        For reference, each of these will be in context of being compared to a baseline human.<br>
    
        <h4>Android</h4>
    
        Androids are synthetic humanoids with clearly robotic visual traits. A handcrafted one is typically more powerful than a store-bought one, though, so if you want a good android just ask :)<br>

        <h4>Moyo</h4>
    
        Moyo are a strange race of blueish slug people. They're slow and sturdy, and rumor has it their blood is quite the drug...<br>
        
        <h4>Red Moyo</h4>
    
        A variant subspecies of the Moyo, the Red Moyo's blood has slightly different properties. Notably, the Red Moyo are almost completely immune to psychic phenomena.<br>
    
        <h4>Rabbie</h4>
    
        Rabbie are genetically engineered humans, enhanced with floppy bunny ears and small, slender bodies. Rabbie are intelligent but constantly nervous and jumpy, and require a special drug known as Planetarium to survive.<br>
    
        <h4>Kurin</h4>
    
        A race of pretty genetically engineered humans, possessing foxlike characteristics. A mostly female race, Kurin are highly sociable creatures, but aren't much good at combat.<br>
    
        <h4>Ratkin</h4>
    
        A cute race of humans genetically engineered to be smaller and possess ratlike traits. Ratkin are notoriously inventive and like frilly things, but aren't very strong.<br>
