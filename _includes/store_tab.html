        <h3>Outline of each race:</h3>
        
        For reference, each of these will be in context of being compared to a baseline human.<br>
    
        <h4>Android</h4>
    
        Androids are synthetic humanoids with clearly robotic visual traits. A handcrafted one is typically more powerful than a store-bought one, though.<br>
    
        <h4>Battle Droid</h4>
    
        Battle Droids are mindless combat drones. They are powerful, but are built purely for battle.<br>
    
        <h4>Droid</h4>
    
        Droids are mindless general-purpose drones intended for labor. They can't do complex work, but are cheap to build and easily replacable.<br>
        
        <h4>Moyo</h4>
    
        Moyo are a strange race of blueish slug people. They're slow and sturdy, and rumor has it their blood is quite the drug...<br>
        
        <h4>Nyaron</h4>
    
        Nyaron are genetically engineered humans, enhanced with catlike traits including ears and a tail. They're strong-willed and agile, but sleep a lot and work slowly.<br>
        
        <h4>Paniel</h4>
    
        Paniel are cyborgs with a steampunk-esque theme. Each paniel is different, possessing skills depending on their model. Paniel require a steady supply of a special fuel to survive.<br>
        
        <h4>Rabbie</h4>
    
        Rabbie are genetically engineered humans, enhanced with floppy bunny ears and small, slender bodies. Rabbie are intelligent but constantly nervous and jumpy, and require a special drug known as Planetarium to survive.<br>
